When I was creating my senior project last semester I had this idea to include an interactive game. My senior project was about the spread of fake news and the dangers that come from it. I wanted to have a simple score-tracking game that had a mix of ABCD questions and true or false questions. I do not know how to code so the problem I was facing was creating an interactive game without the necessity of needing to know how to code. Overall it did the job however, it came with a lot of backtracking and tutorials. When I first opened the program, it seemed to have a similar **User Interface** as Google Slides so my **Mental Model** and overall idea of how the program worked was based on the same functions as Google Slides. So due to that, I tried adding more slides for the rest of the questions on the left side panel with the plus icon. However, when you try adding a slide it has you choose what type of slide rather than just adding a slide. This made it less efficient although I could copy and paste those slides.

Next, I tried adding text for the questions, however, I was confused as to how to manipulate the text and the position since it would not move when dragging it, and did not have tools other than adding a text box and other tools that I couldn't figure out. I was confused about how I could just move and edit text on a slide, it wasn't until I saw when adding slides you can add ones that have templates with questions on them that you can edit. I also was able to choose title slides or slides with text for the instructions and title. I found this to be somewhat **efficient** because it presets text that you can change once you add the slide, although it also is **ineffective** with manipulating the text since you can only change it in the properties panel rather than double-clicking and editing it that way. After, I had to choose the correct question input for the score, so I selected the text of the answers to the question, and within the properties section of that element and I simply had to choose which answer was correct. I knew that my choice was secured because it had me save it when I picked the answer. This was probably the most **effective** element throughout the program since I can change it easily and I know that it is secured because I have to press save to input the answer. After editing the question, an issue came from trying to move from question to question, there was no button included with the slide to move to the next question when it had been answered. Since there were no tools to make a button I had to search around to find where to include one, in the properties panel you must click the question then you can check to include a button onto the slide. From there you can edit the destination of where the button takes the user. However there were some problems with the "next" preset button, so I tried the custom preset button instead and it worked much better.

After I simply repeated that process by creating and editing one ABCD question and one True or False, then copied and pasted however many of each question I wanted. Finally, I added a score slide at the end of the questionnaire which tallied the correct amount of questions when the last question was submitted. It was effective in saying the percentage of correct answers and how accurate you were at answering correctly. This was shown easily after the questionnaire was complete.
